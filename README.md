# RAG-Enhanced-Knowledge-Synthesizer

## Overview

The **RAG-Enhanced-Knowledge-Synthesizer** project demonstrates the development of an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies like **Llama 2.0**, **Langchain**, and **ChromaDB**, this project focuses on enhancing document retrieval efficiency and improving the relevancy of generated answers.

## Features

- **Llama 2.0 Integration**: Leverages Llama 2.0 to handle complex language tasks and ensure high-quality text generation.
- **Langchain Framework**: Employs Langchain to facilitate seamless integration and management of language models.
- **ChromaDB Vector Databases**: Utilizes ChromaDB for efficient document retrieval through vector-based search and indexing.
- **Addressed Hallucination Issues**: Implements techniques to mitigate hallucination issues and ensure accurate and reliable results.

## Project Components

1. **Document Retrieval**: Uses ChromaDB to enhance querying capabilities through vector embeddings.
2. **Answer Generation**: Utilizes Llama 2.0 and Langchain for generating accurate and contextually relevant responses.
3. **Error Mitigation**: Implements strategies to address and reduce hallucination issues in generated outputs.
